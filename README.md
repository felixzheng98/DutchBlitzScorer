# Dutch Blitz Scorer

## About
This app is used for score tracking when playing the card game, Dutch Blitz.

I decided to make this app after discovering the game and then wishing that there was a simpler way to keep track of scores. For those of you that do not know about the game, it is fast-paced card game (a whole game is done in ~15mins), that is usually played at gatherings.

This app is not associated or endorsed by the manufacturer of the Dutch Blitz card game.

## Features
  * Keeps track of all games
  * Material 3 + Dynamic colors
  * Dark theme
  * No ads
  
## App architecture

 * Navigation Component
 * MVVM
 * Room
 * Hilt
 * Material 3

This app uses Android Jetpack's "Navigation Component". The data is stored in a local database using Room. Hilt is used for dependency injection. The app follows Material 3 guidelines closely.

If you have any questions about how something is implemented in the app, feel free to email at felix[at]zhengineer.com.

## Further development / Contributions

Any future development of this app will be in this public repository. I am open to contributions, but it will most likely be difficult or not possible to contribute. This app depends on a private library, which I do not have plans to make public at this time. I will try to remove the dependency sometime in the future... (no SLO :p).
